    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    <ol>
        <h2><li>Golfing</li></h2>
        I have been golfing since 2016 when I started high school and I absolutely love going out on the course with friends and family.
        <h2><li>Hiking</li></h2>
        I started going on hikes with the main goal of swimming in local creeks, my favorite spots are typically over 40 minute walks with cliffs to jump into the ice cold water
        <h2><li>Cooking</li></h2>
        While cooking is a necessary skill it can also become a hobby as you strive for more advanced home cooked meals, I absolutely love making a meal from scratch
