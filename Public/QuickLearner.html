    <h1>Quick Learner</h1>
    I have always been good at picking up on skills quickly which mkaes it extremely easy for me to adapt.
    Any project I dedicat myself to is always open ended to crticism as I am open to learning new methods of task completion.
    I have been told I am easy to work with as I learn quickly and listen to new ideas without bias.
